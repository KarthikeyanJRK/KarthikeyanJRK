## 👋 Hi, I’m Karthikeyan Jeyabalasuntharam  

I’m a data-focused problem solver with a strong interest in **Data Analytics, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Big Data**. I enjoy working with real-world datasets, exploring patterns, and turning data into clear, actionable insights that help answer real business questions.

My toolkit includes **Python, SQL, Power BI, Tableau, and Excel**, along with libraries like **Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Scikit-Learn**. I like working end-to-end: from data cleaning and exploratory data analysis to building predictive models and presenting results using dashboards and reports.

I’ve completed ontario college graduate certificate programs in **Applied AI Solutions Development** and **Cloud Computing Technologies** at George Brown College, Canada, where I worked on projects involving analytics, AI, and cloud-based architectures. I’m especially interested in roles such as **Data Analyst, Data Scientist, or Machine Learning Engineer**, where I can apply data-driven thinking to solve real problems.
